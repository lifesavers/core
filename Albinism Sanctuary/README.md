Equatorial African Albinism Sanctuary
====================================
In Tanzania, which lies as close as you can get to the Equator (6.3070° S, 34.8540° E), life expectancy for a person with albinism of the [oculocutaneous-type](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/oculocutaneous-albinism) (affecting eye and skin) is extraordinarily low: reportedly, 80% die before the age of 30, and 98% are dead by 40. By comparison, total Tanzanian population life expectancy is measured at [61.24 years](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tz.html). 

What's more, in Tanzania and the surrounding region, local medical ritual culture occasionally calls for body parts from persons with albinism. Quite a few Tanzanians born with albinism have been hacked to death (while still alive, and screaming in terror and agony) with a butcher's cleaver, with their body parts fenced and resold by the kilo to witch doctors. The practice is discussed in detail in a National Geographic feature: ["As Tanzania's Albino Killings Continue, Unanswered Questions Raise Fears"](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131011-albino-killings-witch-doctors-tanzania-superstition/). 

The organization [Under the Same Sun](http://www.underthesamesun.com/), and others like it, are struggling to shield Tanzanian citizens with albinism (CWA) from the sun, but nonetheless, the life expectancy of Tanzanian CWA is still so depressed that albinism is effectively a premature death sentence. If these CWA and their nuclear families were to be invited at birth as asylum residents to the United States, with a pathway to citizenship, we could extend CWA lifespan by thirty-forty years, each. Very few could benefit as much from migration into the more northern latitudes of the United States than African Citizens with Albinism. 

Tanzania is an English- and Swahili-speaking nation. Most asylum candidates' families will already know the most common language of the upper-United States, Canada, and other likely "Albinism Sanctuary" countries. National Geographic reports that the CWA population is roughly 100,000 strong in Tanzania, representing .2% of the population of Tanzania. The [average fertility rate is 5.3](http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/tanzania_statistics.html), meaning that an invited nuclear family will eventually number an expected capped average of 7.3 persons. The population seeking sanctuary would be as large as a 730,000 soul absorption, followed by another 18,250 per annum thereafter (2500/CWA births/yr * 7.3 family size). 

By comparison, as of 2012, the United States naturalizes [680,000 citizens per year](http://www.uscis.gov/news/naturalization-fact-sheet). If all Albinism Sanctuary candidates from Tanzania settled exclusively in the United States, and did so spread over a three-year entry period, we could absorb that total with just a 38% increase in naturalization each year, in the year that said Albinism Sanctuary migrants are naturalized. Distributed over a four-year period, the total percentage increase would come to just a 30% added initial four-year naturalization rate, followed by a 2.6% increased rate for every year thereafter.

Historically, these immigration numbers are far less than what the United States has done with regularity in the past, and are far from our immigrant absorption capacity, especially in the more northern latitudes.
