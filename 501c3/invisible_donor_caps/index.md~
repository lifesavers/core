Invisible Donation Cap Status for Corporate Charitable Campaigns
=========================================================
Tax-exempt organizations like the American Cancer Society (ACS) frequently partner with corporations such that the sponsoring organization provides matching funds until a given donation cap is reached. In this [wonderful article on the inefficacy of NFL's Pink October Campaigns] (https://sports.vice.com/article/the-nfls-pink-october-does-not-raise-money-for-cancer-research), the journalist Smriti Sinha notes that less than .01 percent ($1 in $10,000) of the League's 10 billion in revenue went to the month-long annual Pink October campaign, which falls by design in the heart of the regular season. That percentage is even lower when all exclusions to the revenue base are included.

The part that forms the nexus of this proposal was this well-worded question: ".. is there a cap on the amount of money that companies donate? In other words, are sales benefitting women's health after a company's self-imposed donation threshold has been met? In 2010, Reebok set a $750,000 cap on their contribution to the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade regardless of how many of their pink-ribboned products were sold. There was no way for the consumers to know if that limit had already been met." [[Smriti Sinha, Vice Sports]] (https://sports.vice.com/article/the-nfls-pink-october-does-not-raise-money-for-cancer-research) It would be simple to add a regulation that requires large organizations that enter into a formal comarketing partnership with a cause to provide donors with a link where they can monitor the status (and exhaustion) of the corporate cap on matching funds. The "thermometer boil-over" is a popular and natural graphical metaphor to celebrate customers exceeding the pre-determined cap. The partnership need not end when the cap is reached.
