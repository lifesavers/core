Salaam Soldiers: The Mir Мир Soldiers' Manifesto
===============================================
v0.01

Ahimsa, satyagraha are underdeveloped in the world of peacemaking operations, and can help accelerate the establishment of a more CALM calm⁴unity worldwide. National militaries should begin experimencing with ahimsa agent troop deployments in friendly, allied lands, overturning staged enmities through service: long moments of truth, forbearance, and compassion. 

Speaking for a moment from the U|S Perspective, the 9-11 911 attack killed 2,977 people, but led to the deaths of 100,000s Souls as a result of the use of conventional military tactics, which spark guerrilla resentments, particularly in this new age of rampant social media.

Even with a callous narrow lens of U|S Deaths alone, according to Wk, the counterresponse to 911 was the death of over 2,316 U|S soldiers by J015-06-10, with 18,675  maimed or otherwise injured in Afghanistan. The Iraq War cost at least 4,488 U|S Soldier lives, and 32,222 U|S Soldier maimings and other injuries. 

|Part of the problem traces back to how countries only report their own casualties, and not that of their Family members on the other side of the conflict. Every life is a life.|

|Ahimsa Soldiers carry the classification of medical aid workers. To fire upon or fight with an Ahimsa Soldier would be an International War Crime.|

|Willing to lose their life "fighting" for a nonviolent present through an active modeling of what behavior would look like in the world just around the corner.|

|Jack boots, flak jackets, combat gear, camouflage uniforms: they all have the effect of speading fear and distrust when in an arena that trends hostile. Combat uniforms need to be dropped or readapted in favor of Calm uniforms.|

|Ahimsa Agents must be culturally adept, and must carry skills and be able to deliver a series of valuable services, experiences, and know-how to calm⁴unities in need wherever they may walk.|

|If Ahimsa and Satyagraha truly do not work, and the sacrifices extend past the announced level, the secret Congressional level, and the Precedential Level, then, at that point, Partner Nations collaborating with the Originating Lifesaver Labs Military on the problem can effect a crippling isolation of the Country at question, and move forward with Regime Assassination Facilitation, in lieu of air, land, sea invasions that the LL³⁶ Ahimsa Partners do not themselves press, so as to maintain the purity of the multi-stage, multi-party, large coalition dynamic of a truly nonviolent world justice, backed ultimately in the face of adamant and murderous regimes by the threat of force from uninvolved ællied parties.|
