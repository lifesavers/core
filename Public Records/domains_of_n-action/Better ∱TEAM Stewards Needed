Some Domains That Need Better ∱TEAM Stewards (Kohlberg Commons)

Description
-----------

Preface Note: Some of You are motivated by "great" wealth rather than social impact with financial and family security. i'm not interested in passing these domains on to anyone who's looking for killer profits and wild parties. They're all organized as growth-oriented social profits, for which You would be re:warded with respect not with unchecked millions and oversized mansions (hhomes are getting larger and larger and larger, and unstudied, unexamined marriages hharmfully double housing needs) but with satisfying measures of a purposeful life well-lived, a healthy ∱TEAM, and a ∱TEAM Salary to pay off debts and prepare the next generations to be better and better-lived than We were or today, at Our State of Development, can be. That's not to say that working on these Projects and ∱TEAMs won't be fun.. i just can't stand passing these domains out to appetitive or juvenile souls, and there's a lot of that in the hungry⁵ bachelordoms that drive some entrepreneurial and technology subcultures. This isn't a financial bonanza.. it's a hunt for hharmless souls wanting to make a memorable medical impact along a path that means a great deal for century life.

i'll continue adding to this list as i go through my records. i'll hold onto steamlaw.rocks, one medical domain (probably a recovery), and lifesavers.io. i think it's best to keep castlecongress.org on permanent loan, to make sure Incumbants are Complemented and Generally Protected in Year One, to keep Participating Congresses somewhat ceteris paribus for a fær experimentation and redefinition of ∱TEAM Approaches to Office in the 1st 2⁺-Year Exchange Term in the 2→18 Hh|ouse.
