Dear ¡Y! Combinator,

This is a Kohlberg Commons Domain i want to give away to a Rn⁸⁶ing ∱TEAM. Will Y! Combinator take this Hhomestarter Project off my plate and Race It Forward Fast ⏣?

Do y⁵ou know someone who's looking to help outrace the best efforts of the OEDC and Developing World [Poverty Action Lab][JPAL]?  Let's help the Hhomestarters out of Poverty and the typical time-rich, but poor hhomelessness, with options that play to and build their vocal strength (Time, Streetsuasion) and support long-range, Game-based Hhomestarter Achievements.

The new catalyst suggested to "actuate" better Hhomestarter search-tree approaches are License.ed QR Codes, under the 仐 of this domain_tip for a Kickstarter Pillar-Sponsor.ed Brand that can shield the hhomeless from the stigmas and credibility gaps that have generally barred the Hhomeless from getting to the next Stage of Their RPG Adventure.

We/i need your help on a Hhomestarter site with "Game.iff.i.cation" dynamics so that Hhomestarters can quickly meet their Fundraising Cap with Escrow.ed Funds, and invest the temporal surplus back into [life, love, liberty, more-optimal better structured assisted "gobbe" search, earning achievements for their Donors and Backers, etc.].   All You need to spark this Work is a Hhomestarter ID issued by a Partnering, Hi.ly Accountable, Trusted Alliance of Local Poverty Labs, with all solicited donations from Second Day of Launch routed, by City-wide Committed ⩙ill, through the Hh³⁶omestarter's Personal Page.

i've included one sample ∆⇌sign to start Hhomestarter "Streetsuader Social Challenge" Activisms.. Tyvek Wristbands that support cost-conscious patients who want to avoid suffering from Medical Bankruptcies, present.ly the Highly Opaque, Very ∱(Price) Delayed, #1 Cause of Family Bankruptcy in the U|S, largely because no one at point-of-contract and point-of-care: not the Provider, not the In.Dv.i.du'al, is enabled through _EPIC_ and _Cerner_ to know the Transparent Price of Anything. You'll have to watch this to metapourically see how backwards this is, and how badly the Medical System may need Altaration.

Who better to press the case than the Hhomestarters? A few hours on a busy public sidewalk leading toward a hhealthcare center and the Hospital IT will start asking for Point-of-Care P.H.I. Prices to be made available to their newly empowered Patients who are entering having donned a ∱2 Wristband sold to them by a well-informed Hhomestarter, looking to keep Others out of similar troubled times.

Should the Hhomestarter's need further backing, to cover them in the event of an unfriendly challenge to their right to be selling on the public sidewalk, here's Line 7 | 七 of the [Modern Hippocratic Oath][modern_medical_oath], written by Louis Lasagna:

"I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick."

There's got to be a more ideal ∱team catalyst out there for this Work than me.. i can't press this Project forward at the rate that it needs to go, and i don't want to waste anyone's time trying. Perhaps even Dr. Graham might be able to find a ∱team to tap for this Project. This is an extremely interesting project, but it will take time, treasure, ∱kill, dedication. With the right [Partners][Hhomestarter_Alliance_Partners]
