Campaign Finance Reports
========================
Campaign finance is at the very heart of who has access to our democracy, and is currently a determinant for most Representatives and Senators for who gets heard. The transparency of FEC and State campaign finance reports can be improved. For instance, the options for fighting the toxic neurotrauma of K-12 public financed tackle football are constrained by National Football League Gridiron PAC donations. If you have not given as much campaign cash to your Representative or Senator as the NFL, you are unlikely to be heard. You might not even get a meeting. That's what happened in OH-11, in all likelihood. Documentation available on request.

18F opened a discussion on the FEC.gov website to solicit suggestions for website improvements. That discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/18F/fec/issues). Please visit and contribute frequently. 

The FEC Commissioners Contact Us Page can be found with some digging [here](http://www.fec.gov/members/members.shtml). All Commissioners are issued email addresses that follow the CommissionerLastName format (ex: CommissionerGoodman@fec.gov), so even though Commissioner Goodman, the Chair, does not list his office email address, you should be able to reach his Office without bounce-back by following that email pattern.
