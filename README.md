Lifesavers (QALM) Portfolio
===========================
This is a portfolio of life-preserving projects. Most attach to Federal Legislative Branch prerogatives, but others connect to Citizen, 501c3, and Corporate private action, or State and Local programs. All project folders __must__ resolve into reclamations of at least several thousand quality adjusted life years [QALYs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year) or will be pared away and separated into conveniences.

Please explore, comment, critique, and create! You can checkout and branch; just make sure to follow best practices.
