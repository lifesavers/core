Sample Lifesaver Project Directory
==================================
This is a sample simple Lifesaver Project (LSP) Directory. The contents may include anything from mock-ups to whitepapers, copy, circuit schematics, or excel pivotcharts, or articles of incorporation and drafts of proposed legislation. Each project directory should include a clear index.md and README that serve to orient the most casual visitor and the most occasional committer to what's at stake, as well as all reasonable theses generated to date for how to fix the situation at hand with economy. 

Motivation
----------
The original founder's personal motivation is to meet the overarching and overriding obligation to preserve primate life, in all its forms. In Judaism, for example, the obligation of pikuach nefesh overrides all other considerations: even Yom Kippur and Shabbat are explicitly and purposefully suspended whenever it is possible to save a life. The purpose of this lifesavers repository is to share new effective techniques for preserving life with one another, so that we can all benefit from shared committer and accessor rights and responsibilities.

If you can do anything to accelerate the development of any of the projects listed, please please do. Feel free to run with any notion to which you are able to devote your time and talent. We all can help make inroads toward a safer world.
