Sample Lifesaver Project Directory
==================================
This is a sample simple Lifesaver Project (LSP) Directory. The contents may include anything from mock-ups to whitepapers, copy, circuit schematics, or excel pivotcharts, or articles of incorporation and drafts of proposed legislation. Each project directory should include a clear index.md and README that serve to orient the most casual visitor and the most occasional committer to what's at stake, as well as all reasonable theses generated to date for how to fix the situation at hand with economy. 

Please note: All projects in this Lifesavers directory are released under the license listed in the root Lifesavers folder.
