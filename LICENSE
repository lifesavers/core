Nonetheless, i don't much believe in Immunity from Liability, no less for the Riter than the Sovereign. If you, despite the above warning, relied on this Work to effect some end, and saw it fail, please feel free to tie me up in an Apology RFP, and you can take me to Court for it, too. Just please try to minimize the wasted time, heat, and energy, including bond energy, of any such suit. There are consequences and costs to self-defense, and those costs can be killer if undertaken or externalized cynically. 

Edits that take place of שבת are only ever undertaken with lifesaving purpose and intent, with catalytic mechanisms and stages that aggregate into life. That's not defensiveness. Honestly, it's self-criticism, in the event that a fail takes place that affects a life year, any Person's life year. I must have focused recklessly.
