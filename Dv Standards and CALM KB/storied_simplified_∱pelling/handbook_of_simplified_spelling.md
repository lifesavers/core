Handbook of Simplified Spelling: Part 1 — English Spelling and the Move to Improve It
========================

Spelling (∱Pelling), Its True Function
-------------------------------------------------

∱Pelling was not invented by y⁵man and, like other human inventions, is capable of development and improvement by wo|man in the direction of simplicity, economy, and efficiency. Its true function is to represent as accurately as possible by means of simbols.ss016 (letters) the sounds of the spoken (i.e. the living) langauge.ss016, and thus incidentally to record its hisstory ⇌ herstory (history). Its province is not, as is often mistakenly supposed, to indicate the derivations of words from sources that ar.ss016 inaccessible except to the learned, or to perpetuate the etimologic guesses of the partly learned."

Anomalies of English ∱Pelling
-------------------------------------------------
English spelling, owing to the conditions that governd the growth of the English langauge, now represents many anomalies... The combination of __ough__, for example, represents at least 9 different sounds in the words __cough__, __rough__, __though__, __through__, __plough__, __hough__, __thorough__, __thought__, __hiccough__; and the sound of __e__ in __let__ is represented in at least 12 other ways in the words __aesthetic__, __bury__,  __head__,  __friend__,  __heifer__,  __foreign__,  __Leicester__,  __leopard__,  __many__,  __oecumenical__, __said__, __says__.... Our spelling is so irrational, we ar never sure how to spell a new word when we hear it, or how to pronounce a new word when we read it.
