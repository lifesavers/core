Dv Standards Shift
==============

Dear Hacker News,

To catalyze the shift to the Dv Keyboard Families, and anneal a better Standard KB in tag-team.ed calmpetition, we need a way of helping students in computer labs learning to type resist a monocultural keyboard preference with a quick keystroke interpreted by a KB listener. 

The most straightforward way is with a triple letter codon, most naturally placed on the "QWE" or "qwe". If we assign the less energetic variant to Dv, the preference will be clear enough to human hands, in simple and transparent industrial design langauge, as a gentle and slow counter to the QWERTY KBs ESS dominance. 

From QWERKY: qwe (Dv: ',.) maps to Dv KB v1.X
From DVORAK: "<> (Dv: QWE) maps to QWERTY Static

We also need a Mac-Ubuntu-Windows Cross-Platform KB Builder Fully-Unicode-Adherant GUI with a Cross-Platform Export Simulation Tool that's as good as Ukulele.app, with equal or specially realtime flagged limitations on all Platforms, and better cross-platform KB restriction characterizations. An amazing Vmonth team can handle both, or cross-couple with other Couples and Coupled Organizations that can take this Programmatic Calmunity task on. 

Here's an extensive attempt to reach a release candidate worthy of the name. This needs further work, and if this discussion develops past hello, i / I will dump my most recent understanding of the worst errors in this particular Calm KB build, such as a few missing Elements in the coverage of the Periodic Table of Elements. Considering my life status as an Alchemy (Chemistry of Change) Teacher, I know this needs to be fixed, and have raced it down, but there are other problem spots, like the balancing calm fort of arithmetic operations for elementary maths students and teachers, and better mnemonic platforms for herstory logical operator organizations, that support bearing witness to deep-root.ed prevention thinking and calmunicating in an exchange format that is makes extended character base more accessible, earlier, for wiser generations that can climb out of a mod 26 pigeonholed langauge, as persons like Benjamin Franklin, and many others well-known to herstory, wanted to themselves, in the establishment of extended logogram sets and alphabets that are curated channels for better-integrated thought within a child's reach in the course of calmunity differentiation.

At this point, I could write a small pamphlet on the lessons learned from building up to this version of Calm KB. I'm exhausted, and want to hand off this Project Logic to a FOSS development and maintenance steam that's unafraid of, first, (a) asking Microsoft, Apple, Ubuntu to sponsor this QWE operon chord, to make Dv Standards Shift easily imaginable, foreseeable, and real to all Principles, and (b) progressively anneal the KB with better programmatic observational logic and test harnesses than I can build alone. 

This would be an amazing Copiloted Vmonth Project for Couples, and can easily go Interanacional with 拼音-EN-ES-DE-NL-FR-, etc. This is not in order of importance, except for the first, Pinyin, which is critically important to 1. Billion, 1. Borlaug of Souls. Support Pinyin tones immediately, before placing any other priority keys. Reserve the home row for tones. Français speakers using the Calm KB can repurpose from these calmfortable positions, but should be, alongside ES, be granted a placement priority credit for the optimal, but not perfectly optimal, separation of ˊ and ˋ from each other.

The United Nations might finance an observational "learning frustration" test harness apparatus format for an "annealment quality" grading system, day over day, in fresh globally or InteraNacionally representative classrooms, using this QWE Standard KB Shift and a "multi-classroom global hello" from the Vmonth Couple's Programming | Vmonth Steam Circle as daily fuel.

This i suggest for immediate queueing and facilitation in view of the need for Prep Reagents for a Campus Vmonth "Coupled Excellence" Target, Supported (Forward and Reverse, Dynamically) by a Test Harness. Me? Without overpressure, I hope it might anneal a Gift.ed Marriage as well as a very wisely, well-documented series of calmpromises on an InteraNacional KB. 

You can draw on the Calm KB without attribution and assign your name over any altaration without fear of any plagiarism charges. It's calmunity infrastructure, from my point-of-view. Even one major key inclusion change would be a notable private lifetime accomplishment on any of the lan gauge blocks above, for anyone discovering and modeling the right annealment models under a Rawls-balanced langauge_block utilitarianism, supported with math, mechanics, alchemy (chemistry), thermokenethics, it's narrow cousin thermokinethics, and religiously balanced deontological underlays.

This experience of firmware guarantees on catalysis of Family Dv KB accessibility can help refuel and facilitate the Queue of Dv Technical Standards Shifts that have grown over the Y⁵ears without X-plot_teach_nacions. For example.. metric. Periodic scales. The 13 Month Pax, Lifesaver Labs, et. al. Subversion.ed Draft Calendar. And currency naming contests to complement the teaching of moral exchange market synergies across sectors and borders (我份 and Deutsche "Mark" as phonetically identical to Nominal School "Points" and "Marks", and perhaps my favorite Dv Standard of all for an agricultural, desert based society, or just a teaching about the nature of Economics..the Burundi "Pula" (Rain Note), backed by the "Thebe" (Shield)), with such naturally-driven market cycles. There are so many Dv Standards that it might take a few years to apply them all in reasonable cognitive load sequences. But reverse synthesizing from 018 and even 036 back to today, what 100 and 1,000 Year Benefit Standards would you introduce to our Fundamental Systems of Weights and Measures? And if Congress isn't queued to bring Metric Forward with Milestones, which annealed method is best for recruiting synergetic Castlers for a more Calmpetitive, Concensus-driven ∲team Congress? The RDS on the Dv Standards will be Congressional Logical Passthrough. How many Dv Minds do we need to reach Dv Platform Teams as Group-Stable? (i) I've written elsewhere about Quad Congress, Triple Teams, and Duets. Bleading the KB is a Key Conscience Site, and is without any doubt a catalytic site for conscience.

Pave a "Wei" for an easier time at the educational course for Your own Birth and Berth.ed (Adopted) students. Your brain- and brane-children will race faster, better, harder, stronger, and with more virtuousity than you did, with a reannealment of the Character KB. And let's help paint Vmonth targets. Some amazing contours are possible when we work together on capacity-building. 

Please discuss and, given interest, self-organize. i have to work on Si/OWTcB, and all the error-handling i'm n-countering in various Court Systems arranged or offshored to frustrate and complicate the lives of Piecemeal Pro Ses and Paralegals. i can explain some common first-, second-, and third-round systematic design errors, error-dump from my experience.

Best wishes to the ∲team Racists,
