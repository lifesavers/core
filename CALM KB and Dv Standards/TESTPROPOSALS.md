Dear Hacker News Calmuniti,

i've learned thru hard experimence with "trial, trail, and error" that some common programs do not support the whole range of the Calm KB.. at least not Yet. You'll want to either make well-reasoned  assumptions about upcoming support for Expanded KB Ranges, or form graphical reminders for Yourself, with printed, stacked copy of Programmatic Supports in common programs like:
☐ Adobe PDF Reader, 
☐ Preview.app, 
☐ Firefox, 
☐ Chrome, 
☐ Internet Explorer, 
☐ Microsoft Edge, and 
☐ Word.

i love the way that the "Neo Keyboard" Layout Makers laid out their designs. It's in Deutsche, under the Container titled "Die 6 Ebenen". Paired with a test harness, and a booklet series of print-offs and digital releases, this could make the "test coverage" across Common Products apparent and support firms as We try our best to support, as rapidly as we can, the efforts to extend the KB sensibly with test-rigorous annealments cross-practice.
