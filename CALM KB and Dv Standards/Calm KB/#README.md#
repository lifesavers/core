œôø¦.md: Calm KB Pathway Documentation
===================================

The Calm KB is designed to satisfy needs in œôøÑTEAM education, industry, and society that are presently not met to this degree by any other KB that of which i have direct access. 

The KB is based off of the Dv KB, and preserves most of the Dv Layout, with altarations for œôøÑTEAM Education and special character domains that are important to languistic calmunity. 

The KB was built to satisfy the needs that exist for a simple, portable, cross-platform KB that œôø¦ English, œôøÑ English, Español, Français, Braille, Türkçe, Deutsch, Português, œô§²|ess, and œô§²|ess's far, far more ambitious Æncestor, Esperanto. Any compromises that were necessary to make on key positions were decided solely on the basis of the all souls count. Thus, since Español stands as the second most populous native langauge in the world, the ç and ñ are now attached to the home layout, to facilitate quick and easy expression by the widest number. Thankfully, the ç and ñ also advance the degree of comfort that Français and Português speakers will feel with this KB over most all other competing Dv alternatives. 

A few compromises and careful tradeoffs needed to be made on character placements; for instance, the characters of the Türkçe KB are fully supported but more inconvenient than a dedicated Türkçe KB, largely because the Türkçe KB replaces 3 punctuation marks of the Dv KB with specialized accented character output. 

Please feel free to experiment with this KB and start an issue ticket or contribute to it, or fork it and develop an even better œô§²ranch International Dv KB, if a need becomes apparent that this layout does not meet.

Release Notes
=============

Notably, this KB was originally reœô÷Ìsigned in ’¾å’³¤, and in a spurt of work on the way from ’Æü’ËÜ’¾®’ºä to ’Ãæ’¹ñ’¾å’³¤ by ferry’¡¤and has been built to exceed the standard QWERKY KB for ’Éá’ÄÌ‘»° speakers interested in securing quick access to ”¿Ù’²» Pinyin. ’Éá’ÄÌ‘»° Path {officially, Putonghua (PTH), in ”¿Ù’²» Pinyin} is the most populous and most popular first langauge in the world, and the US Extended KB makes it difficult to strike the tonal marks that define ”¿Ù’²» Path's Pinyin Latin character transcription. On this KB, the tone marks are in order on the home row of the right hand, easily reachable, at a minimum of energy or contortion, while holding the Option Key.

v0.07
----
First, my constant apologies for this terrible doc quality. Implicitly, i'm working with STEAM, but i'm often outside the regulation of a direct accounting body i'm held accountable toward. i do want to change that through a more manageable hhandoff and charge distribution, but i find myself failing again and again to conduct the proper intertemporal exchanges to make the hhandoff total, to the degree that the Diverse expects for Divorcing myself from the whirlwind capability of these dev Dv conservation trees.
œò¢ğ Missing single, double, and triple bonds in the œôı£ Ar¹œôóøomatic Life Key Section. The placement naturalLy fits over the punctuation keys  ',., identifiable as the upper left row colaid on the QWERKY keyboard with QWE ('Q., We'). i'm rather embarrassed by this particular gap in care, as well as the next.
œò¢ğ Missing several Periodic closures, caused by misplacements caused by interference with the standing prints on my QWERKY-printed Laptop KB during long-chain initial placements. Fixed with caution and care.



v0.03
-----
This version (0.03) went through multiple release candidate (rc) stages. The latest v003rc6 was focused on the following goals:
œò¢ğ Publication quality for Dr. Gawande's consideration, for worldwide deployment of checklist character
œò¢ğ Support for Basic Six-point International Braille {at Shift-Control-œôø¦ KB}
œò¢ğ Support for classroom lessons in ’²½’³Ø, the Course on Transformation (œôøÑEng: Chemistry; |Eng: œôø¦ Bonding), including superscript + and superscript - {Alt|Option-Control +; Alt|Option-Control -}
œò¢ğ Added support for œôøÑTEAM subjects with alphabetic superscripts and subscripts up to Unicode's Limitations
œò¢ğ Active i18n support for Español {1.76Mœô§©} rebalanced with œôøÑ Standard English {1.57Mœô§©}, Português {0.93Mœô§©}, Deutsch {.39Mœô§©}, Français {.32Mœô§©}, Türkçe {.27Mœô§©} with its fascinating dotless i, and œô§²|ess (œôÒÔranch Logic English, with Storied Spellings) {|English -- Unknown Pop.}. Many of the accented characters for the i18n were already included in the earlier œôøÑPath Release Candidates, in the four written ”¿Ù’²» Pinyin tones {¯,´,œô¤ç,`}. The remainder were tucked into the best places that could be found. Cross-langauge reoptimization suggestions are both welcome and strongly encouraged; a complete simulated annealing study for supported langauge usage patterns vs. the socially dominant KB platform, weighted in part by affected population and in part by letter frequency, could resolve the optimality question more wisely than has already been done.
œò¢ğ Further support of ’Éá’ÄÌ‘»° Path (PTH: Putonghua) characters {4.15Mœô§©}, including the double layer of {’¿Í|”°Ä}, {’¸µ,œò¢ñ}, {’Äó’¹â,œò¢ğ}, {’ÉÔ’À§”°ß,œò¢ò}
œò¢ğ "œò£¾œôø LM" expression is greatly accelerated with "quarter moon crescent, last" (œò£¾) and "for all" (œôø )
œò¢ğ A full range of new and old proprietary codex designators for intellectual and other property is available at Option-W (œôÿÌ), under the Property Claims Dead Key. The Set includes a designator for the Kohlberg Commons (œòÄÑ), Government (DK - œò½ö), General Will (œò¥ê x 5), and The Creative Heaven (€ô¨£œóõ½ä· ). It is missing a symbol for the Creative Commons: €ô¨£œóõ½ä·  may suffice, for your needs, or visit https://creativecommons.org/.
œò¢ğ Extensive logical support for Herstory, in the section titled, "CALMœôóô Herstory". (This section would benefit from mnemonic reorganization, using logical blocks or natural gaugelan |langauge dead key series.)
œò¢ğ Modification of the number row layout from Espagñol layout to accommodate faster file directory navigation and programming with / and \ directory separators and escapes

Although the Option, Shift, and Option-Shift Registers are quite packed, there is still plenty of œôøÑpace in the Control Register's Top Row, and the Shift-Control KB is practically greenfield. Further reoptimizing compression is conceivable, particularly with the Expansion available from Additional "Dead Key" Compressive Functionality.

This release does not yet cover the full symbol set required for Advanced Placement Physics - ’Êª’Íı (Logic of Matter). i / In a future release, the extended registers of this KB may be reorganized to a degree to accommodate all of the keynotes for ’Êª’Íı the Theory of Everything (Physical).

v0.01-v0.02
-----------
Much of the documentation for the earliest stages of Creation were lost long ago, in a disastrous laptop loss. i / I will do my best to document what motivates the choices that are present in the current KB.
