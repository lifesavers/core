Partial Summary of Findings and Progress
========================================

This document is written in a mixture of Old Imperial American English (v02014), and Branch English (of US of Us)

##Background##
As Andrew Carnegie built the national library system in the US, he also firmly supported the Simplified Spelling Board for years, believing that added simplicity to the English language would make high-quality secondary and university education more accessible to all. Review the history of the Simplified Spelling Board (SSB) on Wikipedia, using a moderate mixture of depth- and breadth-first search. Other nations launched more or less successful spelling reform efforts, including Simplied Hanyu (IEN: Chinese), which has been encoded successfully into the Roman alphabet with a 1:1 match to the International Phonetic Alphabet through the Pinyin transliteration system.

In English, many phonetic collisions emerge from terms that are spelled in an identical manner. To add to the pain, a wide variety of possible spellings and an ever larger array of exceptions exist. For example, the word "cough" might lead you to believe that the "-ough" is pronounced like "off". But then you encounter a word like "through", which is pronounced like "thru", or "enough", which is pronounced similar to cough... but not quite.

Enough is enuf. Wurds shud be spelled as they sound. A four-year-old's spelling shud not impede her English ackuisition any more than necesary.

However, the transition to simpler spelling must happen at a glacial (slow and steady) pace, so as to permit an overwhelming plurality to commit to the effort one small step at a time, so as to keep spelling coherent across Branch English and Imperial English, and so as not to offend our sensibilities too greatly at any one cross-section of time. 

##Goals and Measures of Success##
* Tens of thousands of middle school students who could win the National "Simplified Spelling" Bee, with all rules the same but for the source dictionary -- this goal requires that we rid us of all outer-core errors in archaic phonic spelling conversion, like the thoroughly confusing schwa that fells so many studious National Geographic Spelling Bee contestants..  
* Reidentification of populous and neighboring (and soon thereafter, less-populous and distant) geopolitical states and larger cities with their respective national names, within the local tongue (Zhongguo for Imperial English's "China", and "Bharat Ganarayja" for the world's largest democracy and by 02050, the world's most populous country, the Republic of India.
