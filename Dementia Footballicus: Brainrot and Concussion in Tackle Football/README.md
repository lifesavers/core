Dementia Crashus, Crashicus, Headballicus, Footballicus Fraud
=====================

Football is a fraud even in its very name. You don't even use your foot to play football: you use your head, and specifically, you use your head in headball to slap your brain against your skull, and slap other Persons' brains against theirs. Is it any surprise that a sport that can't even get its name straight, and interferes with the adoption of football consistency in the States United on the fields that would be more healthfully applied to nonfraudulent football, can't get their education conscience¹ straight, and steals, damages, denies neurons from and to educators and grand:parents?

conscience: science, done together: mutual knowing. To have and to gain mutual perspective, mutually. Often undertaken in writing with what we think of as "oneself", or in reading the indivieduality of another's deeply considered words. Inseparable from living face-to-face.

Read about the failed Board of Education Bid by Russell Davis. Russell Davis did Right. Those who defeated Russell Davis, and sustained crashicus, just did Wrong.

What worth does the collision version have that soccer without heading, or any other sport, doesn't? Its merits aren't in isolation from other athletic pursuits. Ceteris paribus, let's rip it out from public financing. It's antithetical to the work of education. See the volume loss in the hippocampus, roughly 0.7mL in Division I Players, controlling for age, sex, athletic activity, and that comes out to the size of an M&M. 

But isnt't that only if you get a concussion? No, that's the amount lost by players who never reported a concussion! Those with concussion Hx lost twice that volume, roughly, roughly 2 M&Ms of brain, among those who reached Division I. 

But isn't this a good sport if you're not aiming for a College Scholarship? No, it's still wrecking neural tissue. The health case for Dementia Crashus is schools is baseless, cet. paribus, on all non-collision sports. Go wrestle. Play baseball. Do forensics. Play on the football team.. i mean the non-fraudulent football team, that amazing sport that actually uses the feet, that the males are still a bit weak at globally in States United, versus Deutschland or Brazil. Build that spectacular pipeline, just without the heading, not until the Olympics and Pros.. not in an Educational Space. Wei need those neurons for conscience. The game is the same with chesting, and no heading. Heading in football is, to use an f word, a stupid bachelor/ette party trick.

But what do we do about the Coaches? Employ them elsewhere! Give them another sport to build. Put those great dolors, those great pains, to use elsewhere. Trust me: give them time and opportunity, and they'll prove themselves. Treat them like Veterans in the world of youth sports: give them priority in supporting and organizing youth sports growth gains in any other sport they migrate toward, and help them form calmunities of mutual support turning the conscience of cool full-blast in another direction.

There are some coaches who really were trapped into the sport, and didn't know how to port. Many coaches worked with quite conflicted consciences for a very long time. You'll know the difference, but you must forgive them to a degree for being conformant. Cool evil is suprisingly banal. That's something Deutschland can teach us well, again. The other dose being their Asylum and Refugee System, which is quantitatively of an entirely different order than what people have been blaring false, statistically fraudulent sirens about in States United.

Join Æmericans for Safe Sports on this matter. Get as loud, be as proud, don't let one inertial model drown out the better inertial conscience majority. From now on, you bring MRIs, or you don't get funding. The burden of proof is on you, instantly and all collision sports selected based on MRI Evidence by the journal called Pediatrics asserting neural loss are suspended now on precaution. You don't get a year to institute the Nth rule change; it's the momentum, idiotes, it's fundamental to that sport. If you want a rule change, implement it in one region in some small region of States United that can tolerate another experimental brain deadly attempt at disconfirmation of the existing evidence against in their children. These new branding efforts under different forms of tackle, trying to use the arms as the safety bag you're missing on your helmet are unconvincing, in actual practice. Strap accelerometers in, you'll see rates that aren't conclusively not neurally damaging even in regular practices, and that's not worth an M&M, or even a fraction of an M&M, or hippocampal loss. Noncollision sports that don't head intentionally still should have to produce MRIs, but if the MRIs aren't ready instantly, find the funding somewhere. 

The Public, via the Government, might well pay for it entirely. I don't like the idea that parents might have to cover the cost of their childrens own representative sample MRIs: sports get defunded all the time, and it's just not right. The athletic health access of children should not crash in the least when Grand:parents fall on hard times. I'd say that of private schools, as well, and i don't think there are reasons not to impose a drop in access fee barriers to childhood athletics. Look, consider the intrinsic value of calm health. With one possible exception to Us Publicly Financing: if there's a major Professional League reliant on Youth Sports that can defray or even cover the cost of representative MRIs, as an ongoing quality assurance that the Spectacle of the Professional Sport isn't taking a front seat to neural development.

Let Russell Davis study and take another unpopular stance that's Right. Davis is empirically qualified as a Hippocratic hand Candidate.

To be clear, i, in my understanding of responsibility, can be held responsible for 2 years of childhood brain rot for not writing this, here.
